# Hugging Face Publishing Guide

This guide walks you through publishing your London Historical LLM models to Hugging Face Hub for sharing and deployment.

> **Success Example**: The [London Historical SLM](https://huggingface.co/bahree/london-historical-slm) has been successfully published using this guide!

## **Overview**

Publish your **SLM** (Small Language Model) to Hugging Face with:

- **Automatic model card generation** with comprehensive documentation
- **Complete installation instructions** for users
- **Dataset information** and training details
- **Usage examples** and troubleshooting guides
- **Professional presentation** for the community
- **Updated model** with 30K training steps and improved performance

## **Checkpoint Format Clarification**

**During Training:** All checkpoints are saved in PyTorch format (`.pt` files)
- Use `python 04_training/test_slm_checkpoint.py` to test during training
- Use `python 04_training/test_checkpoint.py` for full model testing

**After Publishing:** Models are available in Hugging Face format
- Use `python 06_inference/test_published_model.py` to test published models
- Hugging Face format is only created when publishing to the Hub

## **Troubleshooting**

### Common Issues

#### "Finetuned" Label Issue
**Problem**: Hugging Face automatically shows "Finetuned" even for models trained from scratch.

**Solution**: 
1. **Update Model Card**: Add "**Trained from scratch**" in multiple places:
   - Model Description section
   - Key Features section  
   - Training Details section
2. **YAML Metadata**: Do NOT include `base_model` field for models trained from scratch
3. **Clarify in README**: Make it clear the model is not fine-tuned

#### Weight Naming Convention Issues
**Problem**: Model weights have `_orig_mod.` prefix that Hugging Face doesn't recognize.

**Solution**: 
1. **Rename weights** in publishing script: `_orig_mod.transformer.wte.weight` → `transformer.wte.weight`
2. **Transpose specific layers** for Hugging Face format (c_attn, c_proj, c_fc, mlp.c_proj)
3. **Make tensors contiguous** after transposition to avoid safetensors errors

#### Context Length Mismatch
**Problem**: Model has 256 context length but config shows 512, causing shape mismatch.

**Solution**:
1. **Auto-detect context length** from checkpoint's positional embedding shape
2. **Set n_positions and n_ctx** to match actual training configuration
3. **Update generation config** to use correct max_length

#### "No files have been modified" Error
**Problem**: Hugging Face skips upload because files appear unchanged.

**Solutions**:
1. **Create new repository** with version number (e.g., `london-historical-slm-v2`)
2. **Manual upload** via Hugging Face website
3. **Force upload** by adding timestamp file (advanced)

#### Authentication Error
```bash
# Re-login to Hugging Face
huggingface-cli login
```

#### Upload Permission Error
- Ensure you're logged in with the correct account
- Check repository permissions
- Verify repository name matches your account

#### Model Loading Error
- Check all required files are uploaded
- Verify model configuration is correct
- Test with a simple example first

## **Testing Your Published Model**

### **Quick Testing (Recommended First)**
```bash
# Test the published model with 10 automated prompts
python 06_inference/test_published_models.py --model_type slm
```

**What this does:**
- Loads model from `bahree/london-historical-slm`
- Tests 10 historical prompts automatically
- Shows model info (vocab size, parameters, etc.)
- Uses SLM-optimized generation parameters
- **No user interaction** - just runs and reports results

**Expected Output:**
```

🎯 Testing generation with 10 prompts...
[10 automated tests with historical text generation]
```

### **Interactive Testing (For Exploration)**
```bash
# Interactive mode for custom prompts
python 06_inference/inference_unified.py --published --model_type slm --interactive

# Single prompt test
python 06_inference/inference_unified.py --published --model_type slm --prompt "In the year 1834, I walked through the streets of London and witnessed"
```

**What this does:**
- **Interactive mode** - you type prompts and get responses
- **Customizable parameters** (temperature, max_length, etc.)
- **Command-line interface** for single prompts
- **Flexible generation settings**
- Good for **exploration** and **custom testing**

### **Python Code Testing**
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

# Load your published model
model_name = "bahree/london-historical-slm"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Generate text
prompt = "In the year 1834, I walked through the streets of London and witnessed"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model.generate(
    inputs["input_ids"],
    max_new_tokens=50,
    do_sample=True,
    temperature=0.8,
    top_p=0.95
)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

### **Expected Output Quality**
Your model generates text like:
> "In the year 1834, I walked through the streets of London and witnessed the most extraordinary sight. The Thames flowed dark beneath London Bridge, whilst carriages rattled upon the cobblestones with great urgency. Merchants called their wares from Cheapside to Billingsgate, and the smoke from countless chimneys did obscure the morning sun."

**Key Features:**
- **Period-appropriate language** ("whilst", "did obscure")
- **London-specific geography** (Thames, London Bridge, Cheapside, Billingsgate)
- **Historical context** (carriages, cobblestones, chimney smoke)
- **Coherent narrative flow**

**Congratulations!** Your London Historical LLM is now available to the world!

**Next Steps:**
1. Share your model with the community
2. Monitor usage and feedback
3. Consider improvements and updates
